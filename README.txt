 Pomodoro clock.  (A FreeCodeCamp.com Zipline task)

DESCRIPTION: 

  The app follows the pomodoro method, usually 25m of session work and 5m of rest. More info at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique

USE:

  The clock is started/paused clicking over it. 

  Length of session or break can be changed when the clock is paused. If the actual slice of time is changed the clock resets to the value selected. 

  When a slice of time ends, a sound is played and the next slice started.

  Values are stored locally with sessionStorage, so even reloading, values are kept until the end of the session.
